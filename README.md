# STRANDS User Interfaces

User interfaces for the robots, displayed using a web browser.

## Requirements

`rosdep` should give you most requirements, but we don't yet have a rosdep for [web.py](http://webpy.org) which is required by `strands_webserver`. This can be installed using, e.g., `sudo pip install web.py`
